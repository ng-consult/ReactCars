     - https://github.com/ng-consult/ReactCars/blob/master/app/store/connections.js
    
 - **Pure LIfeCycle Components** use react-pure-lifecycle
    - https://github.com/ng-consult/ReactCars/blob/master/app/containers/MakeSelect.jsx
    - https://github.com/ng-consult/ReactCars/blob/master/app/containers/Search.jsx
    
 - **custom proxy API** 
 Google DRIVE doesn't allow external Access from webApp (CORS)
